# sails-dynamodb

A [Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline) adapter for DynamoDB. May be used in a [Sails](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails) app or anything using Waterline for the ORM.


> _**Note:** This adapter support the Sails.js v0.10.x. check 0.9 branch if you use before v0.10

## Install

Install is through NPM.

```bash
$ sails new project && cd project
$ npm install sails-dynamodb --save
```
Add your amazon keys to your adapter config


## Configuration

The following config options are available along with their default values:

config/connection.js
```javascript
module.exports.adapters = {

  // If you leave the adapter config unspecified
  // in a model definition, 'default' will be used.
  localDiskDb: {
    adapter: 'sails-disk'
  },

  dynamoDb: {
    adapter: "sails-dynamodb",
    accessKeyId: process.env.DYNAMO_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
    secretAccessKey: process.env.DYNAMO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
    region: "us-west-1",
    endPoint: "http://localhost:8000", // Optional: add for DynamoDB local
  },

};
```

config/models.js
```javascript
module.exports.adapters = {

  // If you leave the adapter config unspecified
  // in a model definition, 'default' will be used.
  connection: 'dynamoDb'

};
```

## Find
Support for where is added as following:
```
  ?where={"name":{"null":true}}
  ?where={"name":{"notNull":true}}
  ?where={"name":{"equals":"firstName lastName"}}
  ?where={"name":{"ne":"firstName lastName"}}
  ?where={"name":{"lte":"firstName lastName"}}
  ?where={"name":{"lt":"firstName lastName"}}
  ?where={"name":{"gte":"firstName lastName"}}
  ?where={"name":{"gt":"firstName lastName"}}
  ?where={"name":{"contains":"firstName lastName"}}
  ?where={"name":{"contains":"firstName lastName"}}
  ?where={"name":{"beginsWith":"firstName"}}
  ?where={"name":{"in":["firstName lastName", "another name"]}}
  ?where={"name":{"between":["firstName", "lastName"]}}
```
You can specify what attributes/keys should be returned from the query as following:
```
  //This will return only name and age in the result (if the field exists in the result)
  ?where={"name":{"equals":"firstName lastName"}, "select": ["name","age"]}
```

### Pagination
__NOTE__: `skip` is not supported!

Support for Pagination is done using DynamoDB's `LastEvaluatedKey` and passing that to `ExclusiveStartKey`.
See: [DynamoDB Documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Query.html)

1. First add a limit to current request

```
/user?limit=2
```

2. Then get the last primaryKey value and send it as startKey in the next request

```
/user?limit=2&startKey={"PrimaryKey": "2"}
```

For more complex queries, you must provide all the fields that are used for an index of the last object returned. An example not using the blueprint apis below. Assume there is a GSI on email (hash) and loginDate (range).

```
// Looking for recent logins by a specific email address
UserLogins.find({
  where: {
    email: 'someone@like.you'
    loginDate: {"lt": new Date().toISOString()}
  },
  limit: 10
}).exec((err, userLogins) => {
  UserLogins.find({
    where: {
      email: 'someone@like.you'
      loginDate: {"lt": new Date().toISOString()},
      startKey: {
        email: 'someone@like.you',
        loginDate: userLogins[userLogins.length - 1].loginDate
      }
    },
    limit: 10
  }).exec((err, moreUserLogins) => {
    doSomethingWithLogins(userLogins.concat(moreUserLogins));
  });
});
```

See that the startKey is in the `where` block and that it has both fields of the Global Secondary Index.

## Using DynamoDB Indexes
Primary hash/range keys, local secondary indexes, and global secondary indexes are currently supported by this adapter, but their usage is always inferred from query conditionsâ€“`Model.find` will attempt to use the most optimal index using the following precedence:
```
Primary hash and range > primary hash and secondary range > global secondary hash and range
> primary hash > global secondary hash > no index/primary
```
If an index is being used and there are additional query conditions, then results are compiled using DynamoDB's result filtering.  If no index can be used for a query, then the adapter will perform a scan on the table for results.

### Adding Indexes
#### Primary hash and primary range
```
UserId: {
  type: 'integer',
  primaryKey: 'hash'
},
GameTitle: {
  type: 'string',
  primaryKey: 'range'
}
```
#### Secondary Indexes (local and global)
Secondary indexes can be specified by adding an `indexes` block to the model definition alongside the `attributes` section. Local secondary indexes use the same `hashKey` as the primary hashkey;  global secondary indexes use a differnt attribute as the `haskKey`.
```
attributes: {
  id: {
    type: 'string',
    primaryKey: 'hash'
  },
  timestamp: {
    type: 'integer',
    primaryKey: 'range'
  },
  name: {
    type: 'string'
  },
  createdAt: {
    type: 'date'
  }
},
indexes: {
  ExampleLocalIndex: {
    hashKey: 'id',
    rangeKey: 'name'
  },
  ExampleGlobalIndex: {
    hashKey: 'name',
    rangeKey: 'createdAt'
  }
}
```
### Generated Ids
Unique ids can be automatically assigned by adding `autoIncrement: true` to the field attributes. The field type must be a string and the assigned id is a UUID not an incrementing integer (DynamoDB has no ability to auto-increment.)

```
  id: {
    type: 'string',
    primaryKey: 'hash',
    autoIncrement: true
  }
```

### Sorting By Indexes
Sorting does not look like how it looks with the normal sails database adapters. You can not sort by an arbitrary field, you must sort by a range field in an index. The index is automatically inferred by what you are querying and you can specify a direction to sort the range fields of the used index. Using the GSI defined above, this will query for descending highscores of Super Mario World:
```
GameScores.find({
  where: {
    GameTitle: "Super Mario World"
  },
  sort: "-1"
})
```

## Update
The `Model.update` method is currently expected to update exactly one item since DynamoDB only offers an [UpdateItem](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateItem.html) endpoint.  A complete primary key must be supplied.  Any additional "where" conditions passed to `Model.update` are used to build a conditional expression for the update.  Despite the fact the DynamoDB updates only one item, `Model.update` will always return an array of the (one or zero) updated items upon success.

## Overwrite
By default, an `InvalidAttribute` error will be thrown when attempting to insert a record with the same primary key(s) as an existing record. To overwrite existing records by default, add the model setting `overwrite: true` alongside the other top-level model settings.

## Testing

Test are written with mocha. Integration tests are handled by the [waterline-adapter-tests](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline-adapter-tests) project, which tests adapter methods against the latest Waterline API.

To run tests:

```bash
$ npm test
```


## About Sails.js and Waterline
http://sailsjs.org

Waterline is a new kind of storage and retrieval engine for Sails.js.  It provides a uniform API for accessing stuff from different kinds of databases, protocols, and 3rd party APIs.  That means you write the same code to get users, whether they live in mySQL, LDAP, MongoDB, or Facebook.
